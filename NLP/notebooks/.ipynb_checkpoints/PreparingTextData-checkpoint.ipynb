    "In order to get a computer to understand a piece of text - whether that's a news headline, a tweet or a Wikipedia article - we need to break it up into components that the computer will recognise. This is called tokenization. We will also want to remove common words like 'and', 'in', 'but', etc to allow the computer to focus on more important words. In NLP, words such as these are known as stopwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will focus on tokenization and stopword removal for preparing text data. In reality, however, there are many more techniques that we could use to prepare our data, such as lemmatization and stemming. You may want to research and implement these techniques for the final challenge!\n",

When we perform tokenization, there are many different things we must consider. Should we split up the text into characters, or words? What should we do about punctuation? In this exercise we will think about some of these issues and build our own basic tokenizer."
